By running the following two commands, you'll get a flask instance
with webpack up and running. It's for another project, but this is
useful to have as boilerplate, and maybe somebody else can learn from
it.

# Flask app
./devserver

# Wepback Bits
webpack-dev-server --config=./webpack/dev.conf.js --port 8081
